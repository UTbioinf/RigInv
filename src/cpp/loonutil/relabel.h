/*! \brief %Relabel strings to contiguous integers
 *
 * RelabelString is implemented by using a trie structure (c.f. cedar.h).
 *
 * In this implementation, the `IndexType` should always be at most 4 bytes.
 * That said, (unsigned) char/short/int are preferred. Using a type that is
 * larger than 4 bytes can lead to significant and unpredictable errors.
 * 
 * The constrains on at 4 bytes may not be a disadvantage, because if the
 * index is too large, the data itself will usually be much larger. But still,
 * we need to be careful, because there genome sequencing data can be extremely
 * large.
